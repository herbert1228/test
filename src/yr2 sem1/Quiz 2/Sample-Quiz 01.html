<b>Quiz 01 Sample [10 marks], time allowed: 20 minutes</b><br>

(This is a sample quiz. Marks will not be counted)<br>

<br>

Q1<br>

(a) Write a class <tt>Computer</tt> with a string
attribute <tt>brand</tt>. Also write its getter and setter
methods. The names of getter and setter methods should be <tt>getWord()</tt>
and <tt>setWord()</tt> respectively if the attribute name
is <tt>word</tt>. <br>

<br>

(b) Add a <tt>main()</tt> method as if it is added in a
testing class. In
this method, create a Computer object <tt>myComputer</tt>,
set its brand to
"My brand", get its brand using the getter method and print it out.
Notice
that in "My brand", the letter "b" is in lower case.<br>

<br>

(c) Add an attribute <tt>price</tt> (double) and its
getter/setter methods.<br>

<br>

(d) Add a no-parameter constructor <tt>Computer()</tt>
which assigns the string "Unknown brand" to <tt>brand</tt>
and 3000 to <tt>price</tt>.<br>

<br>

(e) Add another constructor <tt>Computer()</tt> with the
first parameter to initialize <tt>brand</tt> and the
second one to initialize <tt>price</tt>.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

After writing your program, please compile and run it using the
'Compile and Run' button. If everything is ok, press the 'Compile and
Submit' button to submit it. You can submit more than once. Only the
last submission (within the time limit) will be counted.<br>

<br>

Hint: you may like to add more to the <tt>main()</tt>
method to test the correctness of your class.
However, please remember to comment them out before your submission.
